=head1 NAME

Test::Ping::Ties::PROTO - Protocol Tie variable to Test::Ping

=head1 VERSON

Version 0.02

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In order to allow complete procedural interface to Net::Ping, even though it's an object, I use a Tie::Scalar interface. Every variable is also defined separately to make it cleaner and easier.

At some point they might be joined together in a single file, but I doubt it.

Please refrain from using this directly.

=head1 EXPORT

None.
