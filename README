NAME
    Test::Ping - Testing pings using Net::Ping

VERSION
    Version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
    This module helps test pings using Net::Ping

        use Test::More tests => 1;
        use Test::Ping;

        ping_ok( $host, "able to ping $host" );
        ...

FUNCTIONS
  ping_ok( $host, $test )
    Checks if a host replies to ping correctly.

EXPORT
    ping_ok

SUPPORTED VARIABLES
    Currently some variables are suppose to be implemented but there are
    still no test cases, and until there are test cases (which is exactly
    what I'm working on right now), nothing should be assumed as supported.
    Either wait, write a test or try it out.

INTEND-TO-SUPPORT VARIABLES
    These are variables I intend to support, so stay tuned or just send a
    patch.

  PROTO
  TIMEOUT
  SOURCE_VERIFY
  SERVICE_CHECK
  TCP_SERVICE_CHECK
DISABLED TILL FURTHER NOTICE VARIABLES
  PORT
    There is a possible bug in Net::Ping, in which if you change the port,
    the subsequent test results return bad. I sent a bug report with a test
    case to Net::Ping. Hopefully they will reply soon (either with a patch,
    a fix, or a reason why this isn't really a bug) and as soon as that
    happens, I'll update Test::Ping and the POD.

  BIND
INTERNAL FUNCTIONS
  _update_variables($tb)
    Updates the internal variables, used by Net::Ping.

    Gets the test builder object, returns nothing.

  _has_var_ok( $var_name, $var_value, $description )
    Gets a variable name to test, what to test against and the name of the
    test. Runs an actual test using Test::Builder.

    This is used to debug the actual module, if you wanna make sure it
    works.

        use Test::More tests => 1;
        use Test::Ping;

        $Test::Ping::PROT = 'icmp';
        _has_var_ok( 'PROT', 'icmp', 'has correct protocol' )
